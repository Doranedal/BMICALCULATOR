    the following is how i created my code and the components in it.
Created a program for a BMI calculator that takes the name, age, height, and weight of a person and
stores the data into a file. Allow the application to show weather the user is Underweight,
Overweight, Obese, or Normal.
Made sure i added validation rules.
Added a ‘Show Graph’ button that display a pie chart of the data stored, showing the percentage of
people under certain BMI categories.
Challenge:
Be able to allow the chart to show on the same window? You may need to use another library'''
